# AnimatedVisualizer
Project created in 2017, created a basic Visualizer to showcase experience with Unity and C#.
Song used in build is Diskovr & Vibrant Vibez - Launch

When using the build of the visualizer, there are 2 modes testing the different effects and styles.
Pressing 1 (default) will show a ring with no frequency bands
Pressing 2 utilizes frequency bands to reduce the amount of visual clutter, as well as lerping colours depending on the size of the frequency band.
